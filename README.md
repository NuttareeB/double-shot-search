# Double Shot Search Chrome Extension: Search Bing and Google together

Allows searching in both Bing and Google at the same time by showing the results from both search engines side by side. In other words, this extension enables multi-search across two search engines at the same time by showing the result pages next to each other. This extension works best on high resolution screens.

Technical details: 
* The extension sets itself as the default search engine.
* This extension requires some advanced permissions to force Google to load in an iframe by modifying the X-Frame-Options header Google sends to the browser. We do NOT modify any other page in any other way.
* This extension collects information on the searches issued from the extension. We do not collect information about any other pages or extensions. The data we collect is used exclusively for research to improve search engines. The information is used in aggregate and anonymously.
